# SpaceX-Learning
The goal is to predict whether the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will successfully land. SpaceX advertises the cost of a Falcon 9 launch at $62 million, whereas other providers charge over $165 million per launch. A significant portion of SpaceX's savings comes from reusing the first stage of the rocket. By predicting whether the first stage will successfully land and be reused, we can estimate the launch cost. This prediction is valuable for any competing company that may wish to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.

The objective is to analyze and predict whether SpaceX will be able to reuse their Falcon 9 first stage.
