# SpaceX - IBM Datascience Caption Project

## Introduction


The objective of this project is to predict whether the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will successfully land. SpaceX offers a cost-effective rocket launch option, charging $62 million per launch, whereas other companies charge upwards of $165 million. A significant factor in SpaceXâ€™s cost savings is the reusability of the rocket's first stage. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will land and be reused, we can estimate the overall cost of a launch. This information can be crucial for other companies seeking to compete with SpaceX in the space launch industry.

## Business Problem Statement

SpaceX's competitive advantage in the space launch market is its ability to reuse the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage, allowing them to offer launches at a reduced price of $62 million, compared to competitors charging over $165 million. Predicting the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing can provide insight into launch costs.

As a data scientist employed by a competing startup, my role is to develop data-driven models that can accurately predict the probability of a successful first-stage landing. With these predictions, the company can make more informed and competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts, ultimately gaining a strategic advantage in the market.

## Deliverables
Accurately Predict the Likelihood of the First Stage Rocket Landing Successfully: Leverage data science and machine learning techniques to build models that predict the probability of the Falcon 9's first-stage landing. This prediction is critical in estimating the total cost of a rocket launch.

Explore and Analyze the Data for Insights: Perform data exploration to uncover key patterns and insights that can provide a better understanding of the factors influencing the success of the rocket's first-stage landing, helping to optimize the model's predictions and provide actionable business intelligence.
